# Hellin' Worki - Now, Joe's just a shout away

![Image Logo](logos/linkedin_banner_image_1.png)

Hellin Worki is a video conferencing platform which seamlessly dials your coworkers when you call out their name, a  "Yes" and you are connected. 

## Problem

Telling your coworkers to be constantly connected on 4 hour long video calls is obtrusive, awkward and plain weird. You could stay connected and disable your video, but then they would still hear your chair squeak, the pigeons out the window and the traffic outside. Nothing quite emulates the comradery of your cozy old office, does it?

Nothing quite replaces sitting across the table from each other and collaborating, does it? 

Nope, but Hellin' Worki changes that. 

## Working

1. You and your coworker Joe join a Room.
2. Both enter their usernames
3. The microphone listens and waits for you to say "Hey Joe!"
4. When you do, Joe is notified and he can say, "Yes!" to pickup the call.

That's it!

## Advantages

* Calling out your coworker by their names is natural, uninstructive and seamless
* Responding to calls is as simple and easy
* You don't have to stay connected to the video call for hours on end.
* Your privacy is maintained as you are connected only when you respond.

## Tech Stack

* Twilio Video for the actual Video Conferencing

* Flask Web Framework with Python for the backend.

* Simple HTML and Vanilla JS for the frontend

  and more. 

  

  ## The Build!

  How far along am I?

  I just got the video conferencing demos by Twilio and the Hotword Detection working, so far so good!
