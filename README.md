# Hellin' Worki - Now, Joe's just a shout away

Hellin Worki is a video conferencing platform which seamlessly dials your coworkers when you call out their name, a  "Yes" and you are connected. 

## The Problem

Telling your coworkers to be constantly connected on 4 hour long video calls is obtrusive, awkward and plain weird. You could stay connected and disable your video, but then they would still hear your chair squeak, the pigeons out the window and the traffic outside. Nothing quite emulates the comradery of your cozy old office, does it?

Nothing quite replaces sitting across the table from each other and collaborating, does it? 

Nope, but Hellin' Worki changes that.
